From Statistics to Data Engineering: My Journey to Finding Passion

Growing up, I always heard my father mention how lucrative and promising a career in statistics could be. Given the weight of his words and my own budding interest in numbers, I decided to major in statistics. My tryst with statistics began in high school when I took the AP stats course. The intrigue that course generated in me was a sign; I thought I had found my calling to become a statistician.

Fresh out of high school, I seized an opportunity to intern as a biostatistician during my freshman year of college. The experience was transformative. Not only did I get to hone my skills in R, a programming language widely used in statistics, but I also got a real taste of what life as a statistician might entail. Surprisingly, it involved a copious amount of data cleaning. In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that 95% of my time was dedicated to just that!

As I was navigating the waters of statistics, the world was abuzz with a new term: Data Scientist. The glamour and promise of this new role lured me in, and I set my sights on transitioning into the field of data science. The hunt for relevant experience began, and I landed a position as a BI developer on the BYU campus. Here again, the majority of my tasks revolved around cleaning data and ensuring its integrity.

But, the universe had yet another twist in store for me. The summer sun brought with it an internship opportunity as a data analyst for an advertising company. This was my chance to delve deeper into analytics and find out if it resonated with my professional aspirations. However, reality soon dawned on me. The deeper I got into the analytical side of things, the more I realized it wasn’t my cup of tea.

Yet, as fate would have it, this stint brought forth an unexpected turn. I was handed a project to collaborate with a data engineer. The excitement and fulfillment I derived from this project were unparalleled. It was a lightbulb moment! Could data engineering be my true calling?

Riding the wave of this newfound enthusiasm, I applied for a data engineering internship. The stars aligned, and I bagged the opportunity. Today, as I look back, I can’t help but marvel at the unpredictable twists and turns that have shaped my journey. From dreaming of becoming a statistician to discovering my passion for data engineering, it’s been nothing short of an adventure.

To all those still searching for their true calling, remember that every experience, no matter how unexpected, plays a pivotal role in shaping your destiny. Embrace the journey with an open heart, for you never know where it might lead you.
